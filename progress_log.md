# Task 1. Data Parsing
- Loaded the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame (which uses NumPy under the hood), making it more memory-efficient than JSON due to JSON's verbose text format.
- Chose to load the data into memory using Pandas instead of lightweight databases (e.g., SQLite), as Pandas supports direct data manipulation within Python.
- Identified missing or malformed rows including:
   - Format of the invoice reference (YEAR-REFERENCE NUMBER).
   - Format of date columns (YEAR-MONTH-DAY).
   - Accuracy of 'No. Days Taken to Pay' (Date Paid - Date Invoiced should equal 'No. Days Taken to Pay').
   - Any missing values.
   - Any cases where 'Paid Amount' exceeds 'Invoice Amount'.
- Implemented data validation using code generated by OpenAI ChatGPT, rather than hard-coding it from scratch.

# Task 2. Viewing Company Results
- Implemented the frontend and backend based on code generated by OpenAI ChatGPT instead of hard-coding it from scratch.

# Task 3. Insights for Each Company
- Added 'Min Days to Pay' and 'Max Days to Pay' alongside 'Average Days to Pay'.
- Added 'Monthly Totals'.
- Attempted to integrated an opensource AI client (gpt4ree) to generate human-interpretable insights based on user queries and the DataFrame.
- While typically "late" means over 30 days from the invoice date, defined a company-specific custom criterion for late invoices which are those after the average payment term.


# Task 4. Visualizing the Results
- Visualized the Monthly Totals (Invoice vs Paid)

# Task 5. Deploying it Live
- Deployed the project live for access and usage.

# Task 6. Testing and Documentation
- Conducted testing of FastAPI endpoints.
